from django.db import transaction

def my_view(request):
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
              # Database operations within the transaction
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, log it, or take appropriate actions.
        # Rollback the transaction to maintain data consistency.
        transaction.set_rollback(True)
    finally:
          # Clean up resources or perform any necessary actions




Implementing database rollback in Django is essential when you're performing multiple database operations within a transaction and want to ensure data consistency in case an exception occurs. Here's how you can handle database rollback:

1. **Import the Required Module**:

   In your Django views or functions, import the `transaction` module from `django.db`:

   ```python
   from django.db import transaction
   ```

2. **Wrap Database Operations in a Transaction**:

   Use the `transaction.atomic()` context manager to wrap the database operations you want to include in the transaction. This ensures that either all operations within the block succeed, or none of them are applied:

   ```python
   from django.db import transaction

   def my_view(request):
       try:
           with transaction.atomic():
               # Database operations within the transaction
               # For example, saving multiple objects to the database
               obj1.save()
               obj2.save()
               # Other database operations
       except Exception as e:
           # Handle the exception, log it, or take appropriate actions.
           # Set the rollback flag to True to discard the transaction.
           transaction.set_rollback(True)
       finally:
           # Clean up resources or perform any necessary actions
   ```

3. **Exception Handling**:

   Inside the `try` block, perform your database operations. If an exception occurs during any of these operations, the `transaction.atomic()` context manager will automatically catch it.

4. **Rollback on Exception**:

   In the `except` block, handle the exception as needed (e.g., log it, send an alert). To ensure data consistency, explicitly set the rollback flag to `True` using `transaction.set_rollback(True)`. This action will discard any changes made within the transaction.

5. **Cleanup and Finalization**:

   In the `finally` block, clean up resources or perform any other necessary actions. This block will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

By following these steps, you ensure that if any part of the database operations inside the transaction fails due to an exception, the entire transaction will be rolled back, and no changes will be saved to the database. This helps maintain data consistency and prevents partially applied changes in the event of an error.

Remember that database transactions are typically used for multiple database operations that need to be treated as a single unit of work. Using `transaction.atomic()` ensures that the transaction is atomic, meaning it's either fully completed or fully rolled back. This is particularly important in scenarios where data consistency is critical, such as financial transactions or multi-step form submissions.
